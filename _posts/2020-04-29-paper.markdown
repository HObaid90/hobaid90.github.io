The goal is to design an equation which approximates the solution to the famous Wave-equation, or Maxwell's equations (Maxwell likes inventing things that can't be solved analytically), and therefore simulating electromagnetic radiations inside antennas, radars, satelites, and other telecommunications devices. I designed and developed equation / algorithm that adaptively prioritize regions of complex geometry within devices, and therefore produces a more accurate solution that is less costly.
