In 2016 I joined the [Computational EM Lab](http://www.compem.ece.mcgill.ca/) at McGill University to conduct research in numerical algorithms design & analysis for my master's degree. I published a set of algorithms to compute EM radiations in complex geometry more accurately.  

In 2017 I started working as a software developer at [MicrowaveSoft](http://microwavesoft.com/), a startup company that specializes in communication services and products. I developed scalable predictive algorithms to model RF radiations. 

In 2019 I joined [Cerence Inc.](https://www.cerence.com/) as NLU Software Analyst, where I worked on AI Voice assistant for cars. I tested, analyzed and improved NLU and NLP components and services. 


I'm interested in Software Developement, Sequence modeling (NLP, Time-Series)
